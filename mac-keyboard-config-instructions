Answer used, just in case it is delete
That was a pain for me aswell. Iam working at sometimes at IntelliJ in windows, linux and macOS and just don't want to handle the different layouts mentally.

Ive finally succeeded at having the same layout and I also swapped the control/command buttons on the keyboard (i am using a regular windows keyboard) in all applications except IntelliJ so I can use ctrl + c/v/a/f/... through the whole system.

    changed the keymap in IntelliJ to "Default for XWin"
    installed karabiner-elements which allows any keyboard/mouse changes: https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements

    edited my /Users/username/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json and added my own rule in that json under profiles > complex_modifications > rules:

    {
      "description": "ctrl/command swap",
      "manipulators": [
        {
          "conditions": [
            {
              "bundle_identifiers": [
                "^com\\.jetbrains\\.intellij$"
              ],
              "type": "frontmost_application_unless"
            }
          ],
          "from": {
            "key_code": "left_control"
          },
          "to": [
            {
              "key_code": "left_command"
            }
          ],
          "type": "basic"
        },
        {
          "conditions": [
            {
              "bundle_identifiers": [
                "^com\\.jetbrains\\.intellij$"
              ],
              "type": "frontmost_application_unless"
